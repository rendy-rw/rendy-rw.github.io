    description: 'The communication between peripherals on the Wemos board and the ADS1232 IC is based on the I2C protocol. This communication involves multiple signals operating in sync. In this context, the peripherals require a clock signal as a time reference, which is essential for the calibration process and for transmitting the 24-bit conversion data from the ADS1232 IC.',
